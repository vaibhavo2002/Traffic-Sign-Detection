# Traffic Sign Detection

## Introduction
Traffic sign detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving and intelligent transportation systems. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to build a model capable of accurately classifying traffic signs from image data. The ability to detect and recognize traffic signs is essential for ensuring road safety and assisting both human drivers and self-driving vehicles.

## Data Summary
This dataset consists of traffic sign images categorized into 43 different classes:
- **Training Samples:** 39,209  
- **Testing Samples:** 12,630  
- **Number of Classes:** 43  
- **Image Dimensions:** 64x64 pixels  

## Project Steps
The project is broken down into several key steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Preparing and processing data
4. Building the CNN model
5. Training the model
6. Evaluating model performance
7. Testing the model on new images

## Model Performance
The CNN model was trained over multiple epochs, achieving the following results:
- **Final Training Accuracy:** 99.11%  
- **Final Validation Accuracy:** 97.73%  
- **Final Training Loss:** 0.0296  
- **Final Validation Loss:** 0.1578  

## Model Evaluation
The evaluation results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well on validation data. However, the slight gap between training and validation accuracy suggests potential overfitting. To improve generalization, the following steps can be considered:
- **Data Augmentation** to enhance model robustness
- **Implementing Dropout or L2 Regularization** to reduce overfitting
- **Early Stopping** to prevent unnecessary training
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** for optimized performance
